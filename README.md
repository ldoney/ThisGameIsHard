# ThisGameIsHard

Hello!

This is a game called Warning: This Game is Hard

The premise of the game is that it is rediculously difficult, and is relatively basic. 

I'm only really open sourcing it because I want to be able to go back to it to time and time, and also if anyone would like to see an
example of using Cocos creator to make a simple game!
